My ZSH configuration

Want to add:
1. *FAST* git support: show if there are unstaged changes, staged changes, untracked files, or all clean. This has to be immediate
2. Keybindings: CTRL+Left / Right, CTRL+BACKSPACE, etc
3. Completion: git, nvm, mvn, grunt
4. Facilities to install stuff to the path, new aliases, etc. Bonus points for allowing to remove too. This can be either local or global. For example, a complicated ssh tunnel command: have a way to memorize the command immediately after calling it and allow calling it again by name. But this command may only make sense for the current machine, so don't store it where it will be commited to the git repo.
